For my project, I will analyze the RNA sequence data like always. The data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database repository.
To analyze the data you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using make install.

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run make and this will create a file called Report.html output in your directory that contains the results.

repo's contents are 
    data/
    R/
      R/00_install_packages.R
      R/01_make_figure_sampleA.Rmd
      R/02_make_figure_sampleB.Rmd

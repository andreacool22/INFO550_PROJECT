For my project, I will analyze the RNA sequence data like always. The data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database repository.
To analyze the data you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using make install.

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run make and this will create a file called Report.html output in your directory that contains the results.

repo's contents are data folder, R code folder, figures folder, Report, makefile, readme and analysis structure.
